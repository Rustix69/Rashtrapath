## Hero Section Concept

The hero image will symbolically represent:
- A young woman with her mouth covered softly with cloth (silenced truth)
- A scene of a police bribe (corruption)
- Chains breaking apart in saffron-golden light (truth and reform)
- Overall tone: Hope, reform, courage, and accountability

This imagery will be metaphorical, cinematic, and designed to evoke awareness—not shock.
